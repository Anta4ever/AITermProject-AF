In this project you will watch as a Machine Learning Model (refferenced as AI) will play the game of snake.
With this being said the more time passes the AI will eventually learn from its mistakes and adapt to its environment (This usually spands from 15-20 minutes in real-time.
In order to show a complete change in the way the AI adapts and learns- the demo video had to be speed up in order to accomidate).
As it collects the orbs moving in random directions the AI snake will grown longer- whilst trying to no end the game by getting tangled into it's self.
Prior methods used in previous projects such as Pacman were used in the making of this project.
